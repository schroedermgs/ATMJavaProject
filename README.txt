**** ATM JAVA PROJECT README **** 

This was a full-stack training project utilizing Java, React/JS, CSS, and Derby database/JDBC. 


TASK:  To learn the above through the creation of an "ATM machine" with full withdraw, deposit, 
and transfer functionalities 

I decided to put a creative spin on it, making a mock banking website for a "Bank of Antarctica."

This was a very fun training project and prepared me very well for my role within SMBC. I feel 
enormous gratitude to Rob Delaney, David Lalo, and James Wong for their help and advice. Cheers!
